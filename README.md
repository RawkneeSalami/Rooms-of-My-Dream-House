Rooms of my dream house for p5.js


By Ronnie Saini

Overview
This is a modified verison of Scott Kildalls template for rooms of a house interactive code for P5.js. It is modified to use 123456 as input and displays my images instead of the normal assigned images

Technical Details
I created Preload() function and I added the the array of images. Added to logic of  key flow as all rooms are accessed through the hallway so far.
